# Swift-Comments
[swift-comments](https://www.w3schools.com/swift/swift_comments.asp)

Use comments to explain code.
Swift supports single-line, multi-line(nestable), and documentation comments.
## Single-line and Multi-line
Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.

## Documentation Comments
Use ```///```before declarations to generate documentation,
e.g. for functions,types,and properties.

Documentation comments can include parameters, return values,and more.

## They differ from regular comments in that they are processed 
by the compiler and can be used to generate documentation.
