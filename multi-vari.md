# Swift Multiple Variables.

## Swift Multiple Variables
Declare multiple variable or constants on one line when  they share a type.

## Multiple Variables Declared
Declaring multiple variables or constants on one line is only recommended if it stays easy dto read.

## With Type Annotations
Use explicit types when inference could be ambiguous or to document intent.

## Swift Identifiers

Identifiers name variables, constants,types, functions, etc

## Rules for Identifiers
Identifiers must:
- start with a letter or underscore.
- May include numbers after the first character.
- Avoid keywords unless escaped with backticks.
They can contain Unicode and must not start with a number.

## Escaping Keywords and Unicode
Escape keywords with backticks when needed, and remember identifiers can include Unicode characters.

## Use 
Use backticks to escape reserved words in identifiers, and 
remember Swift identifiers can include Unicode characters.

# Swift Constants
[Swift Constants](https://www.w3schools.com/swift/swift_constants.asp)

## Swift Constants
Use `let` to declare constants that don't change.
## Declare Constants
Use `let ` to bind a value once so it cannot be reassigned later.

## Constants and Collections

If an array is bound with `let`,you can't mutate(change) it.

## Swift Variables in Real-Life
[Swift-variables](https://www.w3schools.com/swift/swift_variables_reallife.asp)

Swift Variables in Real-life
Use variables to track values like counters, flags,and user input.

## Example: Counter
Use a variable to track a counter and print it as it changes

## Greeting 
Store a value in a variable and use interpolation to print it.
## Swift Data Types
[swift data](https://www.w3schools.com/swift/swift_data_types.asp)

Swift Data Types 
Swift has built-in  types like `Int`,`Double`,`Bool` and `String`.
Swift uses ***type inference*** to deduce the type from the value.

## Basic Types
Declare constants with `let` and variables with `var`.
Swift infers the type from the initial value.
