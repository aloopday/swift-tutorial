# Swift Variables
[variable](https://www.w3schools.com/swift/swift_variables.asp)

Declare constants with `let`, variables with `var`, and use type inference
or annotations as needed.
## Constants and Variables
Declare constants with `let` and variables with `var`.
**Constants** cannot be reassigned.

## Swift Type Inference

Swift infers types automatically when possible, but you can also use annotations for clarity.


```
let x = 10 
let y: Int = 20
print(x, y)
```
## This example shows that Swift infers types automatically when possible, but 
you can also use annotations for clarity.

## Optionals
Use `?` to declare values that may be `nil`

## Swift Print Variables

Print values with concatenation or string interpolation
Use `\(value)` to insert values. You can set a separator and a terminator.
## Concatenation and Interpolation

Use concatenation to combine strings and interpolate to embed values inside strings.

## Custom Separator and Terminator

Set a `separator` between items and a `terminator` at the end.
