# Swift Variables
[variable](https://www.w3schools.com/swift/swift_variables.asp)

Declare constants with `let`, variables with `var`, and use type inference
or annotations as needed.
## Constants and Variables
Declare constants with `let` and variables with `var`.
**Constants** cannot be reassigned.

## Swift Type Inference

Swift infers types automatically when possible, but you can also use annotations for clarity.
