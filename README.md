Install the Swift toolchain and run your first "Hello Swift!" program from the terminal or Xcode.

main.swift:A Swift file; the top-level `print ` executes when run.
## Print: Writes text to standard output.Strings use double quotes.

Swift in Xcode
Create a new IOS app project(App template) in Xcode, choose 
Swift as the language, and run on  the simulator.
You can also use a Playground for quick experiments.

Note:Unlike some other languages, in Swift
`let` is used for `constants` and `var` for  variables.

Example explained:
- `let` creates an immutable constant: `var` creates a mutable variable
- `Type annotation` is optional; here we annotate `Double` and `Int`.
- `String interpolation`:`\(expr)`inserts values into strings.

## String Interpolation

In swift interpolation is done using `\(expr)`.
The most common and simple way to use string interpolation is to embed variable
names inside string literals.
